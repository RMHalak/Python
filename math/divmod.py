# One of the built-in functions of Python is divmod, which takes two arguments a and b and returns a tuple containing the quotient of a/b first and then the remainder a.

a = 177
b = 10

print(a//b)
print(a%b)
print(divmod(a,b))

# Here, the integer division is 177/10 => 17 and the modulo operator is 177%10 => 7.
